# Website Navigation Playbook Implementation Audit

This file records evidence before roadmap tasks are checked. A checkbox in
`docs/website-navigation-playbook-roadmap.md` is considered complete only after
the related code, docs, tests, monitoring, or report behavior is inspected or
implemented and the evidence is recorded here.

## Phase 0 Audit: Scope And Safety Contract

Phase 0 starts from the existing safety documentation and validates each public
website safety claim before the corresponding roadmap item is checked.

### Task 1/122: Confirm public-site scope in `docs/safety.md`

- Status: complete.
- Evidence:
  - `docs/safety.md` has a `Public Website Automation Scope` section.
  - The section limits public-site playbooks to operator-authorized navigation.
  - The section names allowed navigation surfaces: pages, search, profile or
    channel, notifications, settings, and composer surfaces that stop before
    externally visible submission.
  - The section requires public-site tasks to keep local task safety controls:
    allowed windows, explicit confirmation for sensitive steps, blocked-state
    stops, and local reports.
- Verification:
  - Reviewed `docs/safety.md` lines 21-40.

### Task 2/122: Document third-party website authorization and rule compliance

- Status: complete.
- Evidence:
  - `docs/safety.md` states that public-site playbooks are limited to websites
    where automation is allowed by the operator's account, organization, and
    the target site's rules.
  - `docs/safety.md` states that the operator is responsible for confirming
    that the account, organization, and site terms permit the intended
    automation.
  - The same section frames playbooks as navigation aids for authorized
    sessions, not a way to create access or ignore site restrictions.
- Verification:
  - Reviewed `docs/safety.md` lines 23-25 and 36-40.
